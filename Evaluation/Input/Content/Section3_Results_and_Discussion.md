The PBPK model for metformin was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was built and evaluated covering data from studies including in particular

* single intravenous administration in a dose range 0.001445 to 1000 mg
* single and multiple oral administrations (as solution or tablets in fasted or fed state) in a dose range of 0.0008556 to 2550 mg

The final model applies active transport of metformin by PMAT, OCT1, OCT2 and MATE as well as passive renal glomerular filtration.

The next sections show:

1. the final model input parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-metformin-final-input-parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-metformin-diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#33-concentration-time-profiles).
